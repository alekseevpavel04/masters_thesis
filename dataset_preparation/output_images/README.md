# Images Will Appear Here

This directory is where the extracted frames from the raw videos will be saved after running the dataset preparation script.

## Instructions

1. **Automatic Creation**: This directory will be automatically created when you run the dataset preparation script for the first time.

2. **Output Files**: After processing, the extracted frames will appear here with filenames in the format:
   - `<video_filename>_frame_<number>.png`

3. **Check Results**: Once the processing is complete, you can find the extracted frames in this directory.

## Notes

- **Do not delete this file**: It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in your repository.
- **If the directory is empty**: It means no frames have been extracted yet. Run the dataset preparation script to start the process.
