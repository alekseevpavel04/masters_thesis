 # Place Raw Videos Here

This directory is intended for storing raw video files that will be used to create the dataset. The videos will be processed to extract frames, which will then be filtered and deduplicated.

## Instructions

1. **Supported Formats**: Ensure your video files are in one of the following formats:
   - `.mp4`
   - `.mkv`

2. **Placement**: Copy or move your video files into this directory.

3. **Processing**: After placing the videos here, run the dataset preparation script to extract frames and create the dataset.

## Notes

- **Do not delete this file**: It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in your repository.
- **If the directory is empty**: The dataset preparation script will not process any videos. Make sure to place your raw videos here before running the script.
