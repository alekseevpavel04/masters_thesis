# Logs Will Appear Here

This directory is where log files will be stored after running the dataset preparation script. Logs are useful for tracking the progress of frame extraction, filtering, and deduplication.

## Instructions

1. **Automatic Creation**: This directory will be automatically created when you run the dataset preparation script for the first time.

2. **Log Files**: Each time you run the script, a new log file will be created with a timestamp in the filename:
   - `<timestamp>.log`

3. **Viewing Logs**: You can open the log files using any text editor to review the script's output.

## Notes

- **Do not delete this file**: It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in your repository.
- **If the directory is empty**: It means no logs have been generated yet. Run the dataset preparation script to create log files.
