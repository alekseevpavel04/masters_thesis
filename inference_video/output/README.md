# Output Videos Will Appear Here

This directory is where the processed (upscaled) video files will be saved after running the application. The upscaled videos are the final output of the video enhancement process.

## Instructions

1. **Automatic Creation**:
   - This directory will be automatically created when you run the application for the first time.

2. **Output Files**:
   - After processing, the upscaled videos will appear here with filenames in the format:
     - `upscaled_<original_filename>.mp4`
   - Example: If the input file is `input_video.mp4`, the output file will be named `upscaled_input_video.mp4`.

3. **Check Results**:
   - Once the processing is complete, you can find your enhanced videos in this directory.
   - Play the videos using any media player to verify the quality of the upscaling.

## Notes

- **Do not delete this file**: It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in your repository.
- **If the directory is empty**: It means no videos have been processed yet. Place your input videos in the `input` directory and run the application.
- **File Formats**: The output videos are saved in `.mp4` format for compatibility with most media players.

## Troubleshooting

- **No output videos appearing**:
  - Ensure that the input videos are placed in the `input` directory.
  - Check the logs (in the `logs` directory) for any errors during processing.
- **Output video quality issues**:
  - Verify that the input videos are of good quality and in a supported format.
  - Ensure that the model files are correctly downloaded and placed in the `model` directory.
