# Logs Will Appear Here

This directory is where log files will be stored after running the application. Logs are useful for tracking the progress of video processing, debugging issues, and monitoring the application's behavior.

## Instructions

1. **Automatic Creation**:
   - This directory will be automatically created when you run the application for the first time.

2. **Log Files**:
   - Each time you run the application, a new log file will be created with a timestamp in the filename:
     - `upscaler_<timestamp>.log`
   - Example: `upscaler_20231015_143022.log` (for October 15, 2023, at 14:30:22).

3. **Viewing Logs**:
   - You can open the log files using any text editor to review the application's output.
   - Logs contain information such as:
     - Start and end times of video processing.
     - Progress updates (e.g., frames processed, time elapsed).
     - Warnings or errors encountered during processing.

## Notes

- **Do not delete this file**: It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in your repository.
- **If the directory is empty**: It means no logs have been generated yet. Run the application to create log files.
- **Log Rotation**: If the logs grow too large, consider implementing log rotation or manually archiving old logs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No logs appearing**: Ensure that the application is running correctly and that logging is enabled in the configuration.
- **Logs are incomplete**: If the application crashes or is interrupted, logs may be incomplete. Check for errors in the last few lines of the log file.
